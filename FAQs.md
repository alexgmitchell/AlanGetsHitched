### Here are the answers to some **Frequently Asked Questions** from other guests.

* *How easy is it to get to the venue without a car/taxi?*<br/>
The venue is a one hour walk away from anywhere with public transport, which is why we have booked a bus from Edinburgh. However, it is only a 5-10 minute drive from West Calder, which has direct trains from Edinburgh and a train link to Glasgow. You can find more information about transport links, the bus and taxis on our [transport page](transport.md).

* *I have no preference whether I give a gift or contribute to your honeymoon, which do you prefer?*<br/>
If you would like to give a gift but have no preference then please contribute to our honeymoon. There is also absolutely no minimum acceptable amount. If you can only afford to give a little, then please only contribute a small amount. We would also like to remind guests that there is no obligation to give us a gift at all! Most of you will have to travel for the occasion which is very expensive and you being there is enough of a gift for us.
