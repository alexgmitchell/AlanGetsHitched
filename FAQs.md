Here are the answeres to some **Frequently Asked Questions** from other guests.

* *How easy is the venue to get to without a car/taxi?*<br/>
The venue is a one hour walk away from anywhere with public transport, which is why we have booked a bus from Edinburgh. However, it is only a 5-10 minute drive from West Calder, which has direct trains from Edinburgh and a train link to Glasgow. You can find more information about transport links, the bus and taxis on our [transport page](transport.md).
