### Here are the answers to some **Frequently Asked Questions** from other guests.

* *How easy is it to get to the venue without a car/taxi?*<br/>
The venue is a one hour walk away from anywhere with public transport, which is why we have booked a bus from Edinburgh. However, it is only a 5-10 minute drive from West Calder, which has direct trains from Edinburgh and a train link to Glasgow. You can find more information about transport links, the bus and taxis on our [transport page](transport.md).

* *I have no preference whether I give a gift or contribute to your honeymoon, which do you prefer?*<br/>
If you would like to give a gift but have no preference then please contribute to our honeymoon. There is also absolutely no minimum acceptable amount. If you can only afford to give a little, then please only contribute a small amount. We would also like to remind guests that there is no obligation to give us a gift at all! Most of you will have to travel for the occasion which is very expensive and you being there is enough of a gift for us.

* *What do I do if I want to camp on site?*<br/>
The most important thing is to please let us know that you wish to do this and how long for (both Friday and Saturday, or just Saturday). This is especially important as you will need to use the facilities at the on-site accommodation. When you arrive, just follow directions to the venue, which are found on [this page](venue.md) and we will be able sort out where you will be able to park your van/pitch a tent then. Please do not arrive before 14:00 on Friday.

Please email us using the address on the home page if you have any questions that have not been addressed on this site.
