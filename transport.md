Our venue is near both Edinburgh and Glasgow, although it is easier to travel to from Edinburgh. Edinburgh has both a major train station and airport that can connect you to the rest of UK/world. For details and location of the venue [click here](venue.md). Read on for further transport information.

Please let us know if you have any questions, we are happy to help!

### The Bus

We have booked a bus that departs from St Andrews Square, Edniburgh at 12:30, to arrive in good time for our ceremony. The bus will then take guests back to Edinburgh at the end of the night, departing from The Barn at 23:45. The bus has space for 31 guests, of which there are 19 spaces left. 

Please let us know if you would like to take this bus asap & we will add you to the list.
