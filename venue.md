## (& how to get there)

We are getting married at [The Barn at Harburn](https://www.harburnbarn.co.uk/),a beautiful converted barn sorrounded by 9 acre estate located just outside of West Calder, West Lothian, Scotland.

For those of you staying in Edinburgh, we have booked a bus that will take you to and from the venue, arriving in time for the ceremony at 14.00 and departing at midnight.<br/>
Please let us know if you would like to take the Edinburgh bus & we will add you to the list.

Alternatively, both West Calder & Livingston have train stations and the barn is a short taxi-ride away.

If you plan on driving, there is some parking at The Barn and you are welcome to leave your car overnight. Please let us know if you plan to do this, so we can make sure there are enough spaces for everyone.
